# NEURON-UI

This repository hosts an experimental prototype for a new user interface for NEURON based on web technologies. 
The available functionality is currently limited to the RunControl panel.
This prototype is being developed in collaboration with the [Neurosim Lab](http://neurosimlab.org/) and the [SenseLab](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/).
